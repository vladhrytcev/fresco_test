# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description App

1. The user can create his own grid or use a ready-made grid (Canvas Digital Policy Model).
2. The following tools are available to the user:
   - cursor (for selecting a shape and its subsequent movement);
   - sticky note;
   - brush;
   - rectangle with text (for creating a custom grid; available if selected custom template);
   - saving button;
   - clear button (for clear canvas from all changes).
3. The rectangle with the text can be moved, rotated, resized, changed the text.
4. To move, rotate and resize the rectangle with text, you need to select the tool pointer and click the rectangle with text. The rectangle will then be wrapped in a blue border and you can move, rotate and resize it.
5. To change the text in the rectangle, double-click the text, type text you want, and press Enter button.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
